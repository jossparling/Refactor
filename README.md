Horiseon is a social media company that helps companies reach their marketing potential to reach their client base. 

The navigation bar at the top of the website offers visitors fluid movement throughout different header elements. Each body element gives readers a short description of what the service offers to clients. Aside from the header elements are three of the top reasons to enlist these services. Putting them aside from the header elements gives the page dimension and quick access to this information without the need for additional scrolling. In the future, we'd like to add additional webpages for each header element & also a form to sign up for marketing emails and updates.
